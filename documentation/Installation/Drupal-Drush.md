# Drush

This describes how to setup Drush on a Mac.

Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal, a 
veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life easier for those of us who 
spend some of our working hours hacking away at the command prompt.

## Requirements

* [Composer](PHP-Composer.md) : 
  We are installing Drush trough composer, make sure that Composer is installed 
  globally.
* [wget](./Homebrew.md#Wget) : Drush uses wget to get packages from the 
  internet.

## Installation

You could install Drush (8) globally using Composer:

```shell
composer global require drush/drush:^8.4
```

But in order to avoid dependency issues, it is best to require Drush on a per-project basis via Composer:

```shell
composer require drush/drush
```

However, it is inconvenient to type `vendor/bin/drush` in order to execute Drush commands.  By installing the [drush launcher](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher) globally on your local machine, you can simply type `drush` on the command line, and the launcher will find and execute the project specific version of drush located in your project's `vendor` directory:

```shell
curl -OL https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher/releases/download/0.10.2/drush.phar
chmod +x drush.phar
sudo mv drush.phar /usr/local/bin/drush
```

## Commands

Overview of available commands:

```shell
drush help
```

## Update Drush

We got Drush from GitHub we can upgrade it anytime to the latest version:

```shell
composer global update
```

## Local drush configuration

You can set or override drush configuration.
Do this by creating a .drush folder within your home folder (if it does not 
already exists):

```shell
mkdir ~/.drush
```

Create (or edit) the drush config file:

```shell
vi ~/.drush/drushrc.php
```

Add following config (as you desire):

### Prevent SVN related errors while using drush dl command or using drush make

In some installations, SVN error notices are shown while downloading modules or 
themes ("sh: line 1: 11912 Trace/BPT trap: 5       svn infoâ€¦").

Source: http://forums.zend.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=107973#p202868

You can prevent this by adding the following line as first line in your drush 
settings (drushrc.php):

```php
// Fix the svn error in CLI.
putenv("DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=''");
```

### Set the environment variable

You can set an environment variable for your vhosts. Drush is run through cli 
and does not know about the vhost settings.

You can set the environment variable in the drushrc.php file:

```php
// Set the development environment.
$_SERVER['APPLICATION_ENV'] = 'development';
```

### Exclude the data of certain tables during drush sql-dump commands

When you run drush sql-dump commands, by default all tables and their data are 
dumped. This includes the data in the cache tables.

You can ignore the data by default by adding the table name to the 
structures-only settings in the drushrc.php file:

```php
// Ignore the data in these tables, but keep the table structures. 
// Make sure to update the list when new cache tables are added.
$options['structure-tables']['common'] = array(
  'apachesolr_attachments_files',
  'cache',
  'cache_admin_menu',
  'cache_apachesolr',
  'cache_block',
  'cache_bootstrap',
  'cache_commerce_shipping_rates',
  'cache_field',
  'cache_filter',
  'cache_form',
  'cache_image',
  'cache_libraries',
  'cache_media_xml',
  'cache_menu',
  'cache_page',
  'cache_path',
  'cache_rules',
  'cache_token',
  'cache_update',
  'cache_views',
  'cache_views_data',
  'history',
  'search_dataset',
  'search_index',
  'search_node_links',
  'search_total',
  'sessions',
  'watchdog',
);
 
// Use the list of cache tables above.
$options['structure-tables-key'] = 'common';
```
